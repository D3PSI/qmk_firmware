[Matt Gemmell][]'s ever-evolving keymap for the Corne, designed for use with iPadOS. There's [a full explanation here](https://mattgemmell.com/a-split-34-key-layout-for-ipados/).

![](keymap_diagram.svg)

- 34 keys (5x3, plus 2 thumb keys, per half)
- One-shot mods that can be carried between layers (via [callum][])
- Single-key Command-Tab (via [callum][])
- No mods on the base layer
- No Tap Dance or Combos
- No animations, OLED, or magic
- 4 layers in the usual Planck momentary setup
- Mostly for writing (what I do)
- Autoshift enabled
- Includes numpad, inverted-T cursors, mouse and scroll-wheel, media keys, and system shortcuts
- Per-key, per-layer RGB LED colours, configured intuitively in the same layout as the keymap
- Only 22kb or so
