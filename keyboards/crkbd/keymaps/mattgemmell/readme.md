[Matt Gemmell][]'s ever-evolving keymap for the Corne, designed for use with iPadOS. I've written about its various iterations [on my blog](https://mattgemmell.com/category/tech/).

## Features

- One-shot mods that can be carried between layers (via [callum][])
- Single-key Command-Tab with auto-held Command (via [callum][])
- No animations, OLED, tap-dance, or combos
- 4 layers in the usual Planck momentary setup
- Mostly for writing (what I do)
- Autoshift enabled
- Includes numpad, inverted-T cursors, mouse and scroll-wheel, media keys, and system shortcuts
- Optional per-key, per-layer RGB LED colours, configured intuitively in the same layout as the keymap
- Small firmware size; easily fits on a Pro Micro
